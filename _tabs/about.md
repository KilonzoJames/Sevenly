🙌 Welcome! I'm James Kilonzo

You might also know me as **`Sevenly`** in cybersecurity circles and the CTF world.

Deeply immersed in the realm of **cybersecurity**, I find immense excitement in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges — the intricate details and the endless rabbit holes they often lead down.

When I'm not exploring the security landscape, I shift gears into **front-end development**, leveraging **React** and **Tailwind CSS** to build sleek, intuitive user interfaces. 

I'm also:

- 🐧 A passionate **Linux enthusiast**
- 🤔 A strong advocate for **continuous learning**
- 💻 A software engineer with a focus on translating abstract ideas into **robust, elegant solutions**..
