**Welcome to My Technical Documentation Hub!**

Hi there! I'm Sevenly 🙌

As a cybersecurity enthusiast 🛡️, CTF solver 🚩, and software engineer 💻, this site serves as my personal repository for documenting tech experiments 🧪, cybersecurity write-ups 📝, and general nerdy deep dives 🕳️. My goal is to break down complex topics 🧩 into fun, easy-to-follow, step-by-step guides 👣.

My fascination with cybersecurity 🔒 is profound, and I relish the opportunity that Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges provide, pulling me into their captivating rabbit holes 🌀 and extensive explorations 🔍.

When I'm not navigating the security landscape 🌐, I shift gears into **front-end development** 🎨 with **React** ⚛️ and **Tailwind CSS** 💨, and love diving into Linux 🐧 and low-level systems ⚙️.

Feel free to explore 🧭, remix 🛠️, and learn 📚 from the content here. I hope you find something useful and insightful ✨!
