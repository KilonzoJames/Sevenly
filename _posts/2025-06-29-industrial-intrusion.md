## Task 5: OSINT 1 - Subdomain Discovery

### Challenge Description

The first challenge required the discovery of subdomains for the `virelia-water.it.com` website.

### Solution Methodology

Our primary approach involved using subdomain enumeration tools and leveraging public data sources.

1.  **Sublist3r for Subdomain Enumeration:**
    We utilized `Sublist3r` to identify potential subdomains for `virelia-water.it.com`. The command and its output are shown below:

    ```bash
    python3 sublist3r.py -d virelia-water.it.com
    # ... (redacted Sublist3r verbose output for brevity) ...

    [-] Total Unique Subdomains Found: 2
    54484d7b5375357373737d.virelia-water.it.com
    stage0.virelia-water.it.com
    ```

    One of the found subdomains, `54484d7b5375357373737d.virelia-water.it.com`, appeared to be an encoded string. Recognizing it as a hexadecimal string, we decoded it to reveal the flag:

    ```bash
    echo 54484d7b5375357373737d | xxd -p -r
    THM{Su5sss}
    ```

### Alternative Approaches

Several other OSINT techniques could have been used to achieve the same result:

1.  **GitHub Search:**
    A targeted search on GitHub for `virelia-water.it.com` yielded relevant repositories:
    * `https://github.com/solstice-tech1/ot-auth-mirror`
        Within the `index.html` file of this repository, a redirect to `https://54484d7b5375357373737d.virelia-water.it.com/reset` was discovered, confirming the hexadecimal subdomain.
    * `https://github.com/solstice-tech1/staging-panel/blob/main/CNAME`
        This file explicitly listed `stage0.virelia-water.it.com`, confirming the second subdomain.

2.  **crt.sh Certificate Transparency Logs:**
    Checking `crt.sh` for `virelia-water.it.com` would also reveal registered subdomains. The entry for `54484d7b5375357373737d.virelia-water.it.com` on `crt.sh` would further reinforce the hexadecimal nature of the subdomain, leading to its decoding.

## Task 6: OSINT 2 - Hidden C2 Information

### Challenge Description

The second challenge involved further enumeration of the previously found subdomains to uncover hidden information.

![OSINT 2 Image](/dzif8ltvg/image/upload/v1751273433/CTF/industrial-intrusion/OSINT/mv9nvfpve0npfiu4xfje.png){: width="400" height="400"}

### Solution Methodology

Our investigation started with the two identified subdomains. While direct web browse of `54484d7b5375357373737d.virelia-water.it.com` did not reveal any immediate leads, we continued our analysis with `stage0.virelia-water.it.com`.

1.  **Source Code Analysis of `stage0.virelia-water.it.com`:**
    Upon inspecting the HTML source code of `stage0.virelia-water.it.com`, we identified a link to an external JavaScript file:
    
    [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SanTzu/uplink-config/refs/heads/main/init.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SanTzu/uplink-config/refs/heads/main/init.js)
    
    This JavaScript file (`init.js`) contained the following object:

    ```javascript
    var beacon = {
      session_id: "O-TX-11-403",
      fallback_dns: "uplink-fallback.virelia-water.it.com",
      token: "JBSWY3DPEBLW64TMMQQQ=="
    };
    ```

## Investigation of `uplink-fallback.virelia-water.it.com`

The `fallback_dns` value, `uplink-fallback.virelia-water.it.com`, immediately suggested a potential Command & Control (C2) infrastructure subdomain. 
Although direct DNS resolution attempts (e.g., `dig ANY uplink-fallback.virelia-water.it.com`) did not yield immediate results, we pivoted to investigating DNS `TXT` records, which are often used to store arbitrary data, including configuration or hidden messages.

    ```bash
    # Initial attempt that didn't yield useful results
    dig ANY uplink-fallback.virelia-water.it.com
    # ... (Output omitted) ...
    ```

1.  **Querying TXT Records:**

    A `dig` query for `TXT` records on `uplink-fallback.virelia-water.it.com` revealed a promising result:

    ```bash
    dig TXT uplink-fallback.virelia-water.it.com

    ; <<>> DiG 9.20.4-3ubuntu1.1-Ubuntu <<>> TXT uplink-fallback.virelia-water.it.com
    ;; global options: +cmd
    ;; Got answer:
    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 58891
    ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1

    ;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:
    ; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 65494
    ;; QUESTION SECTION:
    ;uplink-fallback.virelia-water.it.com. IN TXT

    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    uplink-fallback.virelia-water.it.com. 1799 IN TXT "eyJzZXNzaW9uIjoiVC1DTjEtMTcyIiwiZmxhZyI6IlRITXt1cGxpbmtfY2hhbm5lbF9jb25maXJtZWR9In0="

    ;; Query time: 72 msec
    ;; SERVER: 127.0.0.53#53(127.0.0.53) (UDP)
    ;; WHEN: Sat Jun 28 09:54:55 EAT 2025
    ;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 162
    ```

2.  **Decoding the Base64 String:**

    The `TXT` record contained a Base64 encoded string: `eyJzZXNzaW9uIjoiVC1DTjEtMTcyIiwiZmxhZyI6IlRITXt1cGxpbmtfY2hhbm5lbF9jb25maXJtZWR9In0=`
    Decoding this string revealed a JSON object containing the flag:

    ```bash
    echo eyJzZXNzaW9uIjoiVC1DTjEtMTcyIiwiZmxhZyI6IlRITXt1cGxpbmtfY2hhbm5lbF9jb25maXJtZWR9In0 | base64 -d
    {"session":"T-CN1-172","flag":"THM{uplink_channel_confirmed}"}
    ```

    This Base64 string could also be decoded using online tools that support JWT or generic Base64 decoding, such as [jwt.lannysport.net](https://jwt.lannysport.net/) (though this wasn't strictly a JWT, it shared the same encoding principles).

## Task 7: OSINT 3 - PGP Signature Verification

### Challenge Description

The final OSINT challenge involved investigating a mysterious PGP-signed message related to `virelia-water.it.com`.

![OSINT 3 Image](/dzif8ltvg/image/upload/v1751273434/CTF/industrial-intrusion/OSINT/fbibossnavxkyn2kohtx.png){: width="400" height="400"}

### Contextual Analysis

Initial investigation through GitHub searches for `virelia-water.it.com` led to the `virelia-water/compliance` repository. A specific commit, `bf80b28d73cdbbccaa37c34633de98cd00e7b236` titled "Removing during investigation", raised suspicion. This commit indicated the removal of the "June 2025 OT Alerts Exception report" from the public website.

![Removing during investigation](/dzif8ltvg/image/upload/v1751274565/CTF/industrial-intrusion/OSINT/ponnysodghjuizlmmol7.png){: width="400" height="400"}

Key details gathered about the PGP message:
* The removed report was a routine maintenance notice, signed with PGP, which is unusual and raised suspicion.
* Corporate auditors quietly removed it due to potential malicious intent.
* The message was signed by "DarkPulse" from `alerts@virelia-water.it.com`.
* The message requested confirmation of system integrity at 03:00 UTC.

### Solution Methodology

The core of this challenge was to verify the PGP signature and retrieve the associated public key, which was expected to contain the flag.


1.  **Saving the Signed Message:**
    The provided signed message was saved to a file named `signed_message.asc`. For brevity, the full content is not shown here, but it followed the standard PGP signed message format:

    ```text
    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
    ...
    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
    ...
    -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
    ```

2.  **Attempting Signature Verification:**
    We attempted to verify the signature using `gpg`:

    ```bash
    gpg --verify signed_message.asc
    gpg: Signature made Mon 23 Jun 2025 15:44:52 EAT
    gpg:                using RSA key 88DEDE7B730513BD5EDD6D9FA4F0FEB084A311E5
    gpg:                issuer "alerts@virelia-water.it.com"
    gpg: Can't check signature: No public key
    ```
    As expected, `gpg` indicated that it could not check the signature because the public key (`88DEDE7B730513BD5EDD6D9FA4F0FEB084A311E5`) was not available locally.

3.  **Retrieving the Public Key:**
    To retrieve the public key, we used a public key server (Ubuntu's keyserver in this case), specifying the key ID found in the previous step:

    ```bash
    gpg --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 88DEDE7B730513BD5EDD6D9FA4F0FEB084A311E5
    gpg: key F8ED5BC28874364F: public key "Ghost (THM{h0pe_th1s_k3y_doesnt_le4d_t0_m3}) <solstice.tech.ops@gmail.com>" imported
    gpg: Total number processed: 1
    gpg:               imported: 1
    ```

    The output of the `recv-keys` command revealed the public key details, including the user ID (Ghost (THM{h0pe_th1s_k3y_doesnt_le4d_t0_m3}) <solstice.tech.ops@gmail.com>), which contained the flag:

    **THM{h0pe_th1s_k3y_doesnt_le4d_t0_m3}**

## ðŸ“Œ Takeaway

These OSINT challenges highlighted the importance of:
* **Thorough Subdomain Enumeration:** Using multiple tools and sources (e.g., Sublist3r, GitHub, crt.sh) for comprehensive discovery.
* **Source Code Review:** Always checking HTML and linked external files (like JavaScript) for hidden clues.
* **DNS Record Investigation:** Beyond A/AAAA records, `TXT` records are a common place to store arbitrary data, including C2 information or flags.
* **PGP Key Analysis:** Understanding how to verify PGP signatures and retrieve public keys from keyservers, as flags can often be embedded within key metadata (like the User ID).
* **Commit History Scrutiny:** Git repositories often contain valuable historical data, even for "removed" information.

This CTF provided excellent practice in applying various OSINT techniques to uncover layered information.
