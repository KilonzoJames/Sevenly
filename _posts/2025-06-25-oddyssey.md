## Description

Remember reading The Odyssey in high school? Well I sure don't, because I never did my homework. But I really wanted to get back into the classics and give it a fair shake. The problem is I have a fourth grade reading level and that book is waaaaaay too long.
To solve this, I made a server that reads out tiny chunks of The Odyssey, one at a time, so I can take my time reading it! How is Odysseus gonna get himself out of this one?

- Press the Start button on the top-right to begin this challenge.
- Connect with: `nc challenge.nahamcon.com 30656`

The challenge presents a scenario where a server serves small portions of `The Odyssey` upon user interaction. The goal is likely to retrieve the entire text, or a specific piece of information hidden within it.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution

The core of this challenge involves interacting with a remote server that serves content chunk by chunk. Manually pressing "enter" thousands of times to retrieve the entire text is not feasible. This calls for an automation script.

I used pwntools, a powerful CTF framework for writing exploit scripts, to automate the interaction.


```python
from pwn import * # Import all necessary functions from pwntools

# Define the target host and port
HOST = "challenge.nahamcon.com"
PORT = 30656

# Establish a remote connection to the challenge server
conn = remote(HOST, PORT)

# Specify the output file name where the extracted text will be saved
output_file = "odyssey.txt"

# Open the file in append mode ('a') with UTF-8 encoding to handle various characters.
# The 'with' statement ensures the file is properly closed even if errors occur.with open(output_file, "a", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    try:
        # Loop indefinitely to keep reading data until the connection closes or an error occurs.
        while True:
            # Read data from the connection until the specific prompt "Press enter to continue..." is found.
            # A timeout of 10 seconds is set to prevent the script from hanging indefinitely.  
            data = conn.recvuntil(b"Press enter to continue...", timeout=10)

            # Decode the received bytes into a string, ignoring any decoding errors to prevent crashes.
            decoded = data.decode(errors="ignore").strip()
            print(decoded)

            # Remove the "Press enter to continue..." prompt from the decoded string
            # to keep the output file clean with only the story text.
            cleaned = decoded.replace("Press enter to continue...", "").strip()

            # Only write if there's actual meaningful content after cleaning.
            if cleaned:
                f.write(cleaned + "\n\n")
                f.flush()

            # Send an empty line (simulating pressing Enter) back to the server to request the next chunk.
            conn.sendline(b'')

    except EOFError:
        print("‚úÖ Connection closed by server. All data likely retrieved.")
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("‚õî User interrupted the script.")    # (Ctrl+C)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

# The script will finish and close the file once the loop breaks due to an exception.
```

## Script Workflow Breakdown

Here's how the automation script works step-by-step:

1. Import pwntools: The script begins by importing the pwn library, which provides functionalities for network communication.

2. Establish Connection: It connects to the specified challenge server and port (challenge.nahamcon.com on port 30656) using remote().

3. Output File: An odyssey.txt file is opened in append mode ('a') to save all the incoming text chunks.

4. Loop and Interact:

    - The while True loop continuously reads data from the server.

    - conn.recvuntil(b"Press enter to continue...", timeout=10) is used to read data until the prompt "Press enter to continue..." is encountered or a timeout occurs. This ensures we capture each full chunk.

    - The received bytes are decoded to a string, and the prompt is removed to keep the output file clean.

    - The cleaned text is written to odyssey.txt. f.flush() is called to ensure data is written to disk immediately.

    - conn.sendline(b'') sends an empty line (simulating an Enter press) back to the server, prompting it to send the next chunk.


5. Handle Exceptions Gracefully / Error Handling: The try-except blocks gracefully handle various scenarios:

    - EOFError: Indicates the server closed the connection, implying all data has been sent.

    - KeyboardInterrupt: Allows the user to stop the script.

    - Exception: Catches any other unforeseen errors.

## üßæ Final Result

After the script completed its execution and the connection closed, a comprehensive odyssey.txt file was created, containing the entire text of "The Odyssey" as served by the challenge.

Upon searching the odyssey.txt file using grep, the flag was successfully retrieved:

**flag{0b51aae6b09b85d1bb13b0b8c3003a6a}**

## üß© Summary:
‚ÄúThe Oddyssey‚Äù served as a gentle warmup for scripting network interactions. The main objective was to programmatically interact with a server that streamed text content in chunks. 

Through this, we:
- üß∞ Reinforced automation skills using pwntools to efficiently request and collect all textual fragments.

- üßæ Demonstrated efficient text parsing and saving by cleaning and compiling the streamed data.

- üéØ Practiced flag extraction from a dynamic, accumulated stream, ultimately recovering the hidden flag from the compiled output.
